        <p>As we transition to a more automated society, the core aim of the Centre is to create new AI technologies and advise on the use of AI in science, industry and society. The Centre brings together researchers with a shared interest in fundamental challenges in Machine Vision, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Machine Action, Interpretation and Knowledge Representation.</p>
        <p>The Centre takes inspiration from the vast array of applications across UCL and acts as the engine of methodological progress. The AI Centre has close research and training links to other local AI communities, including the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit and the Alan Turing Institute. The AI Centre is part of UCL's wider AI Strategy and serves as the engine of methodological development across UCL.</p>

    <h2>AI for People & Planet</h2>
    <p>We at the AI Centre believe that Artificial Intelligence has the potential to be a key ingredient towards solving global and society challenges. It is a tool that could be used to improve the world for everyone and tackle problems such as climate change, social inequality and global food insecurity – and so much more.  Socially responsible development of artificial intelligence is a fundamental element of the AI Centre’s mission.</p>
    <p>We aim to be a diverse and inclusive, welcoming centre for people from all over the world from every background. We are always keen to encourage, promote, inspire and provide a platform for all. Many of our events are open to the public and we are keen to continue our tradition of inviting guests from outside of the centre.</p>
    <p>See our <a href="#">Research</a> and <a href="#">Events</a> tab for more.</p>

    <h2>Our Research</h2>
    <p>The AI Centre is one of the world's leading AI research organisations. Whilst recent times have seen tremendous progress, AI is still far from “'solved”. Machines have only a shallow understanding of the world around them and, to advance to the next stage, they need access to the vast knowledge that humans have about our physical world, culture and emotional behaviour.</p>
    <p>The Centre aims to make next-generation AI systems that have enhanced capabilities in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Machine Reasoning and Machine Interaction. To do this we bring world-leading research talent together and work on joint projects that drive progress. Beyond a pure engineering view, we take a principled approach to understanding how to efficiently train machines and interpret their capabilities and performance.</p>
